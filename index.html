        <h1>Us vs The Internet</h1>
        <p>As we all may know the internet can be a very useful tool for us.However have you ever considered that it may be TOO useful that we are in a way dependant on it. We use the web to find fast answers to our inquiries. So much so that we tend to go the internet as our first option for research.I've read an article in which the author breaks down how this has effected our thinking and our attention span to learn and absorb new info. Since the internet is constantly evolving and making us more complacent. Should we want to contact a friend we can easliy do so by going on social media.The sense of keeping face to face interaction is becoming more of a late night thought once we actually begin to feel the toll of how lonely we make ourselves.To top it off we can get sucked into the virtual realm of the internet easily so long as our mobile devices have an internet connection.</p>
